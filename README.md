# Freemaged

Freemaged is a free, lightweight, and privacy-focused image editor that runs directly in your browser. All processing happens on your device, which means your images are never uploaded to a server. It's fast, secure, and ready when you are.

## Development

The project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and vanilla JavaScript. Styles and scripts are nested into the `index.html` and `about/index.html` files.

- `index.html` – The main image editor application.
- `about/index.html` – The separate "About" page, which is also self-contained.

## Running

### Online (Recommended)

The easiest way to use Freemaged is to visit the official website:

### Locally

If you prefer to run the editor offline, you can download the project and open index.html directly in any modern web browser. No build step or server is required.
