# Freemaged

Freemaged is a lightweight browser based image editor. All processing happens in your browser so no images are uploaded to a server. Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser to start editing.

## Development

The project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and vanilla JavaScript. Styles and scripts are separated into the `css` and `js` folders.

- `css/main.css` – custom styles used by the editor.
- `js/app.js` – main application logic.
- `js/about.js` – small script for the about page.

## About Page

The about page lives in `about/index.html` and describes Freemaged's privacy focused approach. A link is provided from the editor to this page.

## Running

No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the directory with any static file server.
